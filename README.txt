# ‚å®Ô∏è StealthAutoTyper ‚Äî Human-like Typing Bot (No Repeats)

StealthAutoTyper is a Windows automation script that simulates **extremely human-like typing behavior** using the low-level **SendInput API**.  

Unlike simple auto-typers, this project introduces:
- Random typing delays
- Occasional typos with backspace corrections
- CPU-aware pacing
- ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù pauses between sentences
- A **no-repeats guard** to prevent accidental multiple runs  

This makes the typing appear natural and indistinguishable from a real user.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** For demos, testing, and educational use only. Do not use in password fields, login forms, or against software policies.
‚ö†Ô∏è Use responsibly. Don‚Äôt target password fields, logins, or any software that forbids automation.
