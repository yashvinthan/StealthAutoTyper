# Stealth Auto Typer - Requirements File

# ✅ No external Python packages are required.
# This script uses only built-in modules and Windows API via ctypes:
# - ctypes
# - tkinter
# - time
# - threading
# - os
# - random
# - psutil (optional, standard on many systems — install manually if needed)

# If psutil is not available, you can install it with:
# pip install psutil
